# Assessment for ABN Amro

## Open Todos
- Add dependency injection to the Console app
- Add configuration to the Console app
- Move database connection string to appsettings
- Add Blazor WebApp

## Notes
- I got time constrained and didn't implement the (Blazor) SPA. I added a Postman collection to test the API instead. The progress indication works
- The app is missing a configuration to switch between the in-memory or in-database algorithm. Please change the implementation in Program.cs (Both in the Console App and the Web API)

- I opted to use a simplistic method as a Database client
- Using the Database unit tests in this manner was a first for me
- I don't have experience in Blazor
